# generator-autobot [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Marabyte/generator-autobot.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/marabyte/generator-autobot)


## Getting Started

### First things first!

Autobot has nothing to do with Michael Bay or the Transformer's franchise.
If you were looking forward to see big explosions, big explosions in slow motion, Megan Fox, Megan fox running in slow motion, or any kind of robots in desguise you're in the wrong place.

Autobot is Yeoman generator that will, hopefully, help you to setting up your frontend webprojects.

### What do you need

Make sure you have the latest version of [Node](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

Then install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) using the command line:

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

To install generator-autobot from npm, run:

```
$ npm install -g generator-autobot
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```
$ yo autobot
```

### How to use Autobot

After initializing Autobot just answer the questions and select the tools you'll need.
Your friendly Autobot will setup everything for you so you can spent more time coding and less time repeating boring tasks.
